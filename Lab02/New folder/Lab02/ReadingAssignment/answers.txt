1. Reading assignment: When should accessor methods be used?
According to Allen Holub's article, accessor methods (getters and setters) should be used sparingly.
They can lead to tight coupling (changes affect many classes) and brittle code (less flexible to class-related changes). 
Instead, it's often better to use parameterized constructors (use parameters to initialize) and factory methods (static) to control object creation and initialization.
Accessors should only be used when you need to expose internal state without exposing implementation details.

2. Question: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
- Yes, Java allows us to create many constructor methods in a class if they have different method signature.
